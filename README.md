# vba-webscraper-internsg

A simple web scraper made for [intern.sg](https://www.internsg.com/jobs/) using Excel and VBA.

I decided to use Excel and VBA for this project as it is the simplest to package and distribute. You can view and edit all the data directly in the same Excel workbook.

## Usage

You can use the "esc" key to interrupt the macro at any point in time when the program is running

Depending on your internet connection, it can take about 10s to scrap 1 page, so you can expect it to run for around 20 min to finish scraping the entire ~120 pages

Most of the regex patterns and HTML classes are hard coded into the script, and may not continue to work if the website is altered
